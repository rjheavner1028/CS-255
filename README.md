Module Eight Journal

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The goal of the DriverPass project was to create a comprehensive system for DriverPass, a company that aims to revolutionize the driver education and testing industry. To increase the effectiveness and accessibility of driver education, the client needed a system with scheduling features, online instruction, and practice exams for driving exams.


What did you do particularly well?
I was good at gathering specific business needs and outlining the system's aims and goals. This promoted a smooth development process and guaranteed that all stakeholders understood the project's objectives.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would concentrate on the non-functional needs aspect of my work if I could go back and edit only one section. The robustness of the system would increase if the performance requirements were improved to take future scaling into consideration. In particular, I would incorporate more thorough stress test settings and backup procedures for managing increased user loads.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I created in-depth user personas and conducted in-depth interviews to understand the demands of the users. These procedures made it easier to comprehend the unique needs of various user groups, including instructors and students. Ensuring smooth access to resources and scheduling tools, as well as creating user-friendly interfaces, were necessary to incorporate these needs into the system architecture. Taking into account the demands of the user is essential because it immediately affects user happiness and system usability, which raises user engagement and increases system effectiveness.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I employ an iterative process for designing software, beginning with requirement collecting and moving through prototyping, user input, and ongoing improvement. Use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams are a few of the invaluable techniques that help visualize the functionality and operation of a system. I would place more of an emphasis on continuous integration and automated testing in the future to uphold high standards throughout the development lifecycle. Involving stakeholders at every stage of development also guarantees that the finished product meets their requirements and expectations.
